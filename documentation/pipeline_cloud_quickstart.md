The first step in using the PipelineCloud is signing up, which you can do here on the dashboard: [dashboard.pipeline.ai](https://dashboard.pipeline.ai).

# Create a token

As the PipelineCloud operates as an API you will need to generate an API token that registers all requests to your account. This includes requests that are generated by you on the dashboard.

To create an API token you must navigate to **"/Settings/API tokens"** as demonstrated below:
